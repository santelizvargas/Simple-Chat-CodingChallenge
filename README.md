## Assignment Details

* We will be developing a simple chat interface, similar to what you will see in many familiar mobile apps. 

* The output should contain all relevant code, tests, explanatory notes, plus any build scripts you would like to include. 

* Please do not include binaries or external packages or libraries you have used.

## The Problem Statement

Create a simple demo chat app that has some basic capabilities:

1. Type in a text message and press a send button. The message should appear in a list on the right side of the view.

1. Simulate a reply which appears magically after a 5 second delay. The message should appear on the left beneath the previous message.

## FAQ

- **What other functionality is required?**  
No other capabilities are required. This is not a trick question and there is no single correct answer. We prefer simple, well tested solutions over clever solutions. The complexity of your solution should reflect that of the problem.

- **What about ambiguity?**  
If there is any ambiguity please add this in a section added to the bottom of the README and make a choice yourself to resolve the ambiguity.

- **How should persistence be handled?**  
In-memory persistence is sufficient for the exercise.

- **Is there a time limit for completing the exercise?**
There is no time limit for how long the exercise should take for you to complete, but we find most people complete the exercise in around 90 mins.
